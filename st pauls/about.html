            <p class="abo2p">Saint Paul the Apostle was an apostle (though not one of the Twelve Apostles) who taught the gospel of Christ to the first-century world. He is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age. In the mid-30s to the mid-50s, he founded several churches in Asia Minor and Europe. Paul took advantage of his status as both a Jew and a Roman citizen to minister to both Jewish and Roman audiences.
According to writings in the New Testament Paul, who was originally called Saul, was dedicated to the persecution of the early disciples of Jesus in the area of Jerusalem. In the narrative of the book of Acts, while Paul was traveling on the road from Jerusalem to Damascus on a mission to “bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem”, the resurrected Jesus appeared to him in a great light. He was struck blind, but after three days his sight was restored by Ananias of Damascus, and Paul began to preach that Jesus of Nazareth is the Jewish Messiah and the Son of God. Approximately half of the book of Acts deals with Paul’s life and works.</p>

        <div class="Curriculum">
            <h1 class="cuh1">Curriculum</h1>
            <p class="aimp">The school follows ICSE syllabus of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination. The medium of instruction is English. Hindi is a compulsory subject and is taught with special emphasis. The course of studies is so formulated as to lay a solid foundation in both languages – spoken as well as written and in Mathematics. In the lower classes Arts and Craft, Music and Dance are integral part of the curriculum. As children progress other subjects are introduced at appropriate level. Socially Useful and Productive Work (SUPW) is now an integral part of our school curriculum. This subject is mandatory for all candidates n order to pass the ICSE Examination. The aim of this subject is to create an attitude of being helpful to others and develop practical skills which will be of use to the child and to the society later on in life.</p>
